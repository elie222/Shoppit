Shoppit
=======

This is an Android app we created for a university project. It has yet to be uploaded to Google Play, but we hope to upload it soon.
Shoppit allows users to find the best prices for items in nearby stores. It works through crowd-sourcing allowing any user to take a picture of an item and upload it to the app.
